# E-Read
### **Background**
An E-Read Management System is software designed to manage a library's core housekeeping functions. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage their asset collections as well as their member interactions. This software assists library in keeping track of books and checkouts, as well as
members' subscriptions and profiles. This management system also entails keeping a database for inputting
new books and documenting books borrowed with their appropriate due dates and collecting fines where it
is applied.
 
### **Introduction**
E-Read is a library services program designed for school libraries that allows students to register for the program using their valid student IDs and corresponding passwords. And use library services such as borrowing and returning books, purchasing books for sale, reading books on library grounds if one does not wish to borrow, and scanning and printing software and hardware items for a price.
 
### **Feature Descriptions of E-Read/Methodology**
The project solution involves linear and non-linear data structures, which consist of two array lists and two hashmaps respectively. This ArrayList and these hashmaps work to help us to enter and store studentsâ€™data, information regarding the books in the library as well as, and library services accessed by the
students. The system has eight methods that will enable the student to access the library services, whereby the operation methods will enable the student to access certain services such as borrow, return, login, etc, only if they enter a valid student ID and its corresponding password. Secondly, Register which permits students to sign up in the system using their names and IDs and allows them to set passwords. The next one is the Login method which allows the student to sign in to the system to access library services if they have already signed up. Thirdly, the system has the Borrow method that authorizes the library to lend the books to the students if they are available. The next one is the Return method to keep track of the books that have been returned to the library. The next method is Donate method which donates funds to the library. Additionally, the Scan method charges the students scanning fees for soft copies, and the Print method requests payment to students for printing services
